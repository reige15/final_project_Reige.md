## Final Project Process


# Part I: Health Literacy in The United States, a Leading Social Disparity in Health Care

## Outline: 
High level summary: The Health Literacy Rate in the United States is much lower than other developed countries. Through this data visualization I will attempt to show the discrepency by country and metrics that give insight into the problem further.

## Initial Sketches: 
My initial sketches are a little rough, but going aloneg with my outline I would like at least three main sections: 


# One focused on the US

# One focused on the US vs other developed countries

# One focused on what this means for patients and the system as a whole

## The Data: 
The data source I will use for this project is from the CDC mainly. Currently the CDC has an entire section related to health literacy filled with U.S. and other country studies and data. I will use this data and these reports to complete my data visualizations. Within this data source a few datasets are going to be most helpful for me: National Center for Education Statistics, who has information and data from a report they conducted in 2006, https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/2006483.pdf and NIH who has many published articles, but one of which intrigues me the most for this project is Health literacy in Europe: comparative results of the European health literacy survey (HLS-EU), https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25843827/. Additionally, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has a good amount of data on this topic and even an interactive heatmap which will be useful to compare with my other findings, http://healthliteracymap.unc.edu/. All of this data, although from different resources, will infact aid in a robust collection of data to use and present my findings to support my hypthoses that the US is behind in health literacy, leaving gaps in the already very holey American health care system. 
Within the comparitive to other countries I will be most likely using the NCBI article I touched upon (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25843827), but also I want to touch upon lightly the amount of illiterate people within the US compared to other countries to show the baseline of health literacy as it related to literacy at all. The NCES has a few great data sets on the topic of literacy and how it compares to the United States, especially this particular dataset callled  Adult Education Attainment and Assessment Scores: A Cross-National Comparison (https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2018007). I do worry that some of this data is based in PDF and not xls or txt, so I will have to do a little converting and scrapping. 
## Method & Medium:
I plan on completing my final project is building my story in a mix of Tableau and Shorthand. The portion of Tableau will allow me to create data images which I can pair with the words in Shorthand and allow for a scrolling function for the audiance. Additioanlly, Shorthand does a lovely job of allowing images to be larger and smaller sizes, which will allow for screen shots to be emphasised as need be. I do wonder about integrating Tableau features into Shorthand and how that will be possible, but I will play around in the tool some more to see how that may be possible. 
By collecting my data from the sources listed above, I will be able to create insightful and educational visuals in Tableau. Once I have created these visuals I will put them into Shorthand. I have been thinking about just doing a dashboard in Tableau alone, but I am not sure that will convey a message as well as one with data and words. I think telling a story in Shorthand will overall aid my position to be most successful, whereas just using Tableau I may have to exclude important concepts for the sake of data. 

I want the overall final project to be a progression of a story, and Shorthand seems like the best way to do that from the tools we have used. I also want it to be data driven and visual, meaning Tableau will be useful. I will also have to use a bit of Excel and a PDF --> Excel converter to get the data into Tabealu in the first place as many of my sources do not have OData or any other way to directly link to Tableau. 

## Part II
# Developed wireframe/storyboard 
# User Research Protocol 
What I hope to find during my interviews: 
Research Questions/Script: 
Documented Findings: 
a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
