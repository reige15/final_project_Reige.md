# Part 1: Health Literacy in The United States, a Leading Social Disparity in Health Care

## Outline: 
High level summary: The Health Literacy Rate in the United States is much lower than other developed countries. Through this data visualization I will attempt to show the discrepency by country and metrics that give insight into the problem further.
