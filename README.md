## Final Project Process


# Part 1: Health Literacy in The United States, a Leading Social Disparity in Health Care

## Outline: 
  --> High level summary: The Health Literacy Rate in the United States is much lower than other developed countries. Through this data visualization I will attempt to show the discrepency by country and metrics that give insight into the problem further. 
  --> Project structure: 
      Setup: Americans are provided information about their personal health
      Conflict: Americans cannot understand or interpret the information
      Resoultion: Americans are left uninformed, confused, and untreated when compared with other developed nations
