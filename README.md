## Final Project Process


# Part I: Health Literacy in The United States, a Leading Social Disparity in Health Care

## Outline: 
High level summary: The Health Literacy Rate in the United States is much lower than other developed countries. Through this data visualization I will attempt to show the discrepency by country and metrics that give insight into the problem further.

## Initial Sketches: 
My initial sketches are a little rough, but going aloneg with my outline I would like at least three main sections: 


# One focused on the US

# One focused on the US vs other developed countries

# One focused on what this means for patients and the system as a whole

## The Data: 
The data source I will use for this project is from the CDC mainly. Currently the CDC has an entire section related to health literacy filled with U.S. and other country studies and data. I will use this data and these reports to complete my data visualizations. Within this data source a few datasets are going to be most helpful for me: National Center for Education Statistics, who has information and data from a report they conducted in 2006, https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/2006483.pdf and NIH who has many published articles, but one of which intrigues me the most for this project is Health literacy in Europe: comparative results of the European health literacy survey (HLS-EU), https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25843827/. Additionally, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has a good amount of data on this topic and even an interactive heatmap which will be useful to compare with my other findings, http://healthliteracymap.unc.edu/. All of this data, although from different resources, will infact aid in a robust collection of data to use and present my findings to support my hypthoses that the US is behind in health literacy, leaving gaps in the already very holey American health care system. 
Within the comparitive to other countries I will be most likely using the NCBI article I touched upon (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25843827), but also I want to touch upon lightly the amount of illiterate people within the US compared to other countries to show the baseline of health literacy as it related to literacy at all. The NCES has a few great data sets on the topic of literacy and how it compares to the United States, especially this particular dataset callled  Adult Education Attainment and Assessment Scores: A Cross-National Comparison (https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2018007). I do worry that some of this data is based in PDF and not xls or txt, so I will have to do a little converting and scrapping. 
## Method & Medium:
I plan on completing my final project is building my story in a mix of Tableau and Shorthand. The portion of Tableau will allow me to create data images which I can pair with the words in Shorthand and allow for a scrolling function for the audiance. Additioanlly, Shorthand does a lovely job of allowing images to be larger and smaller sizes, which will allow for screen shots to be emphasised as need be. I do wonder about integrating Tableau features into Shorthand and how that will be possible, but I will play around in the tool some more to see how that may be possible. 
By collecting my data from the sources listed above, I will be able to create insightful and educational visuals in Tableau. Once I have created these visuals I will put them into Shorthand. I have been thinking about just doing a dashboard in Tableau alone, but I am not sure that will convey a message as well as one with data and words. I think telling a story in Shorthand will overall aid my position to be most successful, whereas just using Tableau I may have to exclude important concepts for the sake of data. 

I want the overall final project to be a progression of a story, and Shorthand seems like the best way to do that from the tools we have used. I also want it to be data driven and visual, meaning Tableau will be useful. I will also have to use a bit of Excel and a PDF --> Excel converter to get the data into Tabealu in the first place as many of my sources do not have OData or any other way to directly link to Tableau. 

## Part II

# User Research Protocol 

## Research Questions/Script and what I hope to learn: 
I am conducting this interview in hope to get clarity on changes my storyboard may need as well as get any feedback. Are you able to see what I sent/am sharing? Great! Thank you for your time with this matter and participation. This should only take about 10 minutes. I will be taking notes while we talk, so sorry for that in advance.  

      
      What was your main takeaway from the storyboard as it stands now?
		
      Were you confused by anything?
      
      Was anything hard to read or in a font that was hard to see?
      
      Do you feel like there is a call to action?
      
      Do you understand the importance of the topic?
      
      Is there any other feedback you have?

Thank you again for your time. 

## Documented Findings: 
# The target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
I want my target audience to be educated people, college level or above who may be able to change the way medical information is conveyed to the public and patients. 
# Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
I interviewed available people who fit in my criteria for my audience. I interviewed my sister who is currently in law school, my mom who is a physician and my friend who is in my program but not this class. This will give me a good insight into what I need to change and what I do well and how my target audience is recieving this information. However, these people may able be bias considering they know me.

# Changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 
Since my interview I think I will be changing a few things about my storyboard, they are listed below: 

  
      1. I would like to make the images bigger and probably will keep the begginning format of the words over the images consistent for the entirety of the storyboard 	
      (so that there is more time to look at the visuals and they are bigger, but then the words will follow and guide to the next image and so on) 
      
      2. I will be sure to better label my graphs/charts are to be sure that at first glance my audience will understand what is going on 
      
      3. I will use more easily understod data visualizations to guide my story to the conclusion that is necessary 
      
      4. I will eliminate one of the graphs that is redundant and also does not add anything (the second graph about the health literacy rate by state)
      
      5. I will be more explicit in the comparision of health literacy to literacy 


# Part III: 

## Reflection on Changes since Part II ^

# Audience 
My audience is still college educated and up (in terms of education) to ensure that the need and understanding if why health literacy is important would most likely be assumed or already know by the viewer. However, I had to adjust a few things surrounding the final version of the lab work that would be able to be read by people who are educated, but may not know medical jargon and medical terminology. This is helpful too as it shows my point. I also wanted to make sure that my story I was trying to tell was compelling enough but also understandable, and thus I had to make the images and charts a little bigger and better. 

With my audience in mind I tried to ensure that the information I was showing was relevant and from a reliable source. I also had to ensure that the language was at the level for a college graudate. Furthermore, I thought about using a persona to walk through my story, but by the time I thought about it was too late. I felt that showing facts and comparisons to other countries some people look up to as "good" countries would allow for me to show my audience that the issue is larger than nations. 
# Summary

Since the completion of Part II, I was able to get a better view of what needed to be changed through interviews and through seeing other's on class. . I ended up moving away from Tableau and more towards Inforgram, which made for a better story within Shorthand. This was the biggest shift and was a result of the interviews where I realized the visulizations I was spending the most time on, where being overlooked because of their size and the work arounds with Tableau. Using Instagram allowed me to better represent my data and tell my story in a more transparent and aesthically pleasing way. Additionally, this allows for my audience to be able to interact with these datavisulizations becasue they are embedded instead of being screenshots. 

This process was very long, I cannot lie. It took me HOURS to figure out how I wanted to show something, the colors, the format, and making sure it was part of the story. There were many times I would start to create a visualization I thought was cool and then realize it was outside of my story and would not add to it if I added it in. Additionally, I wished I had picked a different topic with better data available. I tried to use the data I thought was readily available, but it was in an .AM file, which meant I had to download the software to code it and the clean it and then ship it out into a format that works with the data tools we are using, and that quickly took too much time and I had to scrap it. I  I guess I learned to better dig into the data before you pick a topic, and to better know your tools and what is available before you get halfway through a project. Basically, I should have spent more time planning and less time doing.
