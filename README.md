## Final-Project-Part III 

## Reflection on Changes since Part II 

# Audience 
My audience is still college educated and up (in terms of education) to ensure that the need and understanding if why health literacy is important would most likely be assumed or already know by the viewer. However, I had to adjust a few things surrounding the final version of the lab work that would be able to be read by people who are educated, but may not know medical jargon and medical terminology. This is helpful too as it shows my point. I also wanted to make sure that my story I was trying to tell was compelling enough but also understandable, and thus I had to make the images and charts a little bigger and better. 

With my audience in mind I tried to ensure that the information I was showing was relevant and from a reliable source. I also had to ensure that the language was at the level for a college graudate. Furthermore, I thought about using a persona to walk through my story, but by the time I thought about it was too late. I felt that showing facts and comparisons to other countries some people look up to as "good" countries would allow for me to show my audience that the issue is larger than nations. 
# Summary

Since the completion of Part II, I was able to get a better view of what needed to be changed through interviews and through seeing other's on class. . I ended up moving away from Tableau and more towards Inforgram, which made for a better story within Shorthand. This was the biggest shift and was a result of the interviews where I realized the visulizations I was spending the most time on, where being overlooked because of their size and the work arounds with Tableau. Using Instagram allowed me to better represent my data and tell my story in a more transparent and aesthically pleasing way. Additionally, this allows for my audience to be able to interact with these datavisulizations becasue they are embedded instead of being screenshots. 

This process was very long, I cannot lie. It took me HOURS to figure out how I wanted to show something, the colors, the format, and making sure it was part of the story. There were many times I would start to create a visualization I thought was cool and then realize it was outside of my story and would not add to it if I added it in. Additionally, I wished I had picked a different topic with better data available. I tried to use the data I thought was readily available, but it was in an .AM file, which meant I had to download the software to code it and the clean it and then ship it out into a format that works with the data tools we are using, and that quickly took too much time and I had to scrap it. I  I guess I learned to better dig into the data before you pick a topic, and to better know your tools and what is available before you get halfway through a project. Basically, I should have spent more time planning and less time doing.
